                    I am a dedicated Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M University set to graduate in December 2025. With a perfect GPA of 4.0/4.0, I am committed to academic excellence and passionate about various aspects of computer science.

My technical skills encompass a wide range of programming languages, including Python, C++, C#, C, JavaScript, ARMv8, x86 assembly, and Verilog. I am well-versed in frameworks and libraries such as React, Express, Unity, ROS, PyTorch, and the OpenAI API. Additionally, I have practical experience with essential tools like Git, Docker, and Node, and have worked with databases like MongoDB and Firebase.

My technical interests revolve around Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Engineering, Computer Architecture, and Computer Systems. These areas fascinate me, and my coursework reflects my dedication to exploring their intricacies.

During my internship at the National Renewable Energy Lab, I contributed significantly to the design and simulation of novel circuit-equivalent models for Grid-Forming Inverters. My involvement in projects like the SEC Alumni Hub and Parasite Paradise showcases my commitment to creating innovative solutions and effective project management.

In the SEC Alumni Hub project, I developed a dynamic web-scraper and integrated a GPT-powered search chatbot, enhancing user experience and reducing maintenance requirements. As the project manager for Parasite Paradise, I successfully led a team of developers, story writers, digital artists, and sound engineers.

My technical skills and areas of interest are not only reflected in my academic achievements but are also evident in my hands-on experience and contributions to real-world projects. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology and am poised to make meaningful contributions to the field of Computer Science.
